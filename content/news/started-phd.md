After graduating in April (officially M.Sc., yay!), I just started my PhD at the [Chair of Chemical Process Engineering](https://www.avt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/avt/forschung/~bjorgs/udchemische-verfahrenstechnik/?lidx=1) at the RWTH Aachen University, led by Prof. Dr.-Ing. Matthias Wessling. I am excited to dive into interesting research, take on teaching, mentor students, and experience all the other tasks this position has to offer.
