With one last view of the Manhattan skyline and a sweaty walk through Central Park, I’m leaving America and heading back home to Germany. It was an incredibly enriching time: I was part of an amazing research lab, met such welcoming people, and experienced breathtaking nature. Overall, I truly enjoyed living the American life.
