I successfully defended my [dissertation](https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/1009669?ln=en) "Tailoring the Characteristics of Complex-Shaped Microgels" _summa cum laude_! It was an intense and thrilling time, with so much that I learned, both scientifically and personally. I’m proud to have finally earned this title and excited for what comes next.
