This is Lea, welcome to my personal website! I am interested in all things artificial intelligence, but specifically AI for science, including reasoning models, geometric ML and physics-aware deep learning! I am currently a PhD student at the RWTH Aachen University, Germany, developing Physics Foundation Models. In my free time, I usually still code, whether its more research or fun projects. I also love to work out, hike and snowboard. This is where I share my work, thoughts, and research. All beliefs are my own, and sometimes they might just be generic ramblings.

Feel free to reach out if you want to connect at Lea.M.Wiesner [at] gmail [dot] com.
