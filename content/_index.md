Welcome to my personal website!

I’m passionate about life sciences, project management, and team development. With an academic background in biotechnology and a PhD in chemical process engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany, I spent several years researching how to tailor complex-shaped hydrogels for biomedical purposes.  <!-- Now, I just started as ... at ... in ... -->

Outside of work, I enjoy being active – from pickleball and partner acrobatics to regular gym sessions. I also love sewing and designing my own clothes, working on creative side projects, experimenting in the kitchen, going for hikes, or capturing nature through photography. Anything creative and inspiring tends to catch my interest.

On this website, I share some of my thoughts as well as recent achievements – since I’m not much into social media.
Feel free to reach out at Lea.M.Wiesner [at] gmail [dot] com. I'm always happy to connect.
