abstract = """We describe an impedance-based method for cell barrier integrity testing. A four-electrode electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) setup can be realized by simply connecting a commercial chopstick-like electrode (STX-1) to a potentiostat allowing monitoring cell barriers cultivated in transwell inserts. Subsequent electric circuit modeling of the electrical impedance results the capacitive properties of the barrier next to the wellknown transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). The versatility of the new method was analyzed by the EIS analysis of a Caco-2 monolayer in response to (a) different membrane coating materials, (b) two different permeability enhancers ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and saponin, and (c) sonoporation. For the different membrane coating materials, the TEERs of the standard and new protocol coincide and increase during cultivation, while the capacitance shows a distinct maximum for three different surface materials (no coating, Matrigel®, and collagen I). The permeability enhancers cause a decline in the TEER value, but only saponin alters the capacitance of the cell layer by two orders of magnitude. Hence, cell layer capacitance and TEER represent two independent properties characterizing the monolayer. The use of commercial chopstick-like electrodes to access the impedance of a barrier cultivated in transwell inserts enables remarkable insight into the behavior of the cellular barrier with no extra work for the researcher. This simple method could evolve into a standard protocol used in cell barrier research."""
