abstract = """The porous structure of microgels significantly influences their properties and, thus, their suitability for various applications, in particular as building blocks for tissue scaffolds. Porosity is one of the crucial features for microgel–cell interactions and significantly increases the cells' accumulation and proliferation. Consequently, tailoring the porosity of microgels in an effortless way is important but still challenging, especially for nonspherical microgels. This work presents a straightforward procedure to fabricate complex-shaped poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels with tuned porous structures using the so-called cononsolvency effect during microgel polymerization. Therefore, the classical solvent in the reaction solution is exchanged from water to water–methanol mixtures in a stop-flow lithography process. For cylindrical microgels with a higher methanol content during fabrication, a greater degree of collapsing is observed, and their aspect ratio increases. Furthermore, the collapsing and swelling velocities change with the methanol content, indicating a modified porous structure, which is confirmed by electron microscopy micrographs. Furthermore, swelling patterns of the microgel variants occur during cooling, revealing their thermal response as a highly heterogeneous process. These results show a novel procedure to fabricate PNIPAM microgels of any elongated 2D shape with tailored porous structure and thermoresponsiveness by introducing the cononsolvency effect during stop-flow lithography polymerization."""
