abstract = """Recent studies show the importance of hydrogel geometry for various applications, such as encoding, micromachines, or tissue engineering. However, fabricating hydrogel structures with micrometer-sized features, advanced geometry, and precise control of porosity remains challenging. This work presents hierarchically structured hydrogels, so-called hydrogel patches, with internally deviating regions on a micron-scale. These regions are defined in a one-step, high-throughput fabrication process via stop-flow lithography. Between the specified projection pattern during fabrication, an interconnecting lower crosslinked and more porous hydrogel network forms, resulting in at least two degrees of crosslinking within the patches. A detailed investigation of patch formation is performed for two material systems and pattern variations, revealing basic principles for reliable patch formation. In addition to the two defined crosslinked regions, further regions are implemented in the patches by adapting the pattern accordingly. The variations in pattern geometry impact the mechanical characteristics of the hydrogel patches, which display pattern-dependent compression behavior due to predefined compression points. Cell culture on patches, as one possible application, reveals that the patch pattern determines the cell area of L929 mouse fibroblasts. These results introduce hierarchically structured hydrogel patches as a promising and versatile platform system with high customizability."""

... I developed hierarchically structured hydrogel patches with spatially defined crosslinking and porosity using a one-step stop-flow lithography process, and showed how pattern design directly controls compression behavior ...
This has been my favorite research project so far, and I also wrote a blog post about it to share the journey of this research and explain the patches in a more accessible way. <!-- [blog post](https://lwsnr.github.io/blog/physics-foundation-model/) -->
