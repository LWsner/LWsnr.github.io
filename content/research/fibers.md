abstract = """For successful material deployment in tissue engineering, the material itself, its mechanical properties, and the microscopic geometry of the product are of particular interest. While silk is a widely applied protein-based tissue engineering material with strong mechanical properties, the size and shape of artificially spun silk fibers are limited by existing processes. This study adjusts a microfluidic spinneret to manufacture micron-sized wet-spun fibers with three different materials enabling diverse geometries for tissue engineering applications. The spinneret is direct laser written (DLW) inside a microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip using two-photon lithography, applying a novel surface treatment that enables a tight print-channel sealing. Alginate, polyacrylonitrile, and silk fibers with diameters down to 1 µm are spun, while the spinneret geometry controls the shape of the silk fiber, and the spinning process tailors the mechanical property. Cell-cultivation experiments affirm bio-compatibility and showcase an interplay between the cell-sized fibers and cells. The presented spinning process pushes the boundaries of fiber fabrication toward smaller diameters and more complex shapes with increased surface-to-volume ratio and will substantially contribute to future tailored tissue engineering materials for healthcare applications."""
