I enjoy a wide range of sports – even if I sometimes have to push myself to get started. Once I do, it clears my mind, and the sense of accomplishment afterwards makes it more than worth it. That’s why I regularly go to the gym to stay healthy and fit.
For a few years, I trained partner acrobatics quite intensively and still love every spontaneous session that comes up. I also enjoy playing volleyball; with beach volleyball being even better.
At the beginning of 2025, during my research stay in the U.S., I discovered pickleball. I had never heard of it before, but instantly fell in love with the sport, especially combined with the spring and early summer weather in Virginia.
