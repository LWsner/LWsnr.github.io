Hiking is one of the most enjoyable and memorable things for me, especially when it’s combined with traveling and exploring beautiful nature. Some of the most beautiful hikes I’ve done recently were in Zion National Park in Utah, the Everglades in Florida, and at Königssee in Bavaria.
Zion National Park is definitely a place I long to return to. It’s perfect for simply enjoying nature. I visited in summer with temperatures around 40°C, but thanks to the low humidity, I actually enjoyed the heat, even though the hikes were quite exhausting. Resting (as you can see in the picture) can be just as enjoyable as hiking.
The most exciting hike was a wet walk with my legs deep in the Everglades (as proven in the picture). It was a completely different experience, but absolutely worth it. I probably wouldn’t have dared without a guide, who warned us about the alligators so we could safely pass them and thankfully only see them from a distance.
My most memorable hike, however, was the one overlooking the stunning Königssee, because that’s when I got engaged.
Still, even smaller hikes are a lot of fun, especially when I’m with friends and discovering beautiful landscapes. It’s even better when we’re rewarded with breathtaking views like the ones in Shenandoah National Park in Virginia (as shown in the mountain-top picture).
