If I find the time and the right mindset, I love getting creative and expressing myself in different ways – from capturing nature through photography to making homemade sushi in the kitchen.
I especially enjoy sewing and developing concepts for my projects beforehand. I also regularly experiment with new ideas and materials. That’s how I ended up creating a “sleeping” clay flower pot (the picture explains it better than words).
Even simple balcony gardening helps me unwind. Most importantly, all of these projects leave me with something tangible and satisfying that I can continue to enjoy long after the creative process itself is over.
